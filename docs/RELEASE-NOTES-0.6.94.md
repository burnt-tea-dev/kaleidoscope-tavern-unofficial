# 0.6.94: Readable brewing instructions in the shared guide

The standalone recipe page previously displayed four untranslated
`minecraft:water_bucket` rows and omitted the barrel's operating instructions.
It now separates liquid volume, counted ingredients, the collection container,
operation and aging into labeled sections. Shaker ingredients retain their slot
positions; ordinary food recipes combine repeated materials without inventing
crafting-grid positions.

Machine details come from the same registered recipe as Cookery's existing
preparation card. The optional chapter receives the same instructions, localized
native ingredient names and registered custom-fluid names. Standalone Tavern
continues to work without Cookery or the managed-server addon configuration. The seven
entrances, all recipe alternatives and drink-effect descriptions remain intact.

Thirty guide regressions cover the reported ice-tea registration, repeated shaker
slots, unknown generic preparation records, custom fluids and the optional wire
payload. The actual World Liquor ice-tea page is also checked in its paired
0.1.56 release. Static and zero-player BDS evidence cannot certify client forms.
Human display acceptance remains pending after the authorized live update.

Release identity advanced to avoid the parallel shaker candidate’s version. Prior frozen candidate hashes remain in release history.
